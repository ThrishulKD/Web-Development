    <blockquote>One morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole. He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers, and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber. The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow
        canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water. 'You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads,' she kept saying to them; and every
        now and then she showed them how it was done. But the little ducks paid no attention to her. They were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all. 'What disobedient children!' cried the old Water-rat; 'they
        really deserve to be drowned.' 'Nothing of the kind,' answered the Duck, 'every one must make a beginning, and parents cannot be too patient.' 'Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,' said the Water-rat; 'I am not a family man. In fact,
        I have never been married, and I never intend to be. Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher. Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship.' 'And what, pray, is your idea
        of the duties of a devoted friend?' asked a Green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard the conversation. 'Yes, that is just what I want to know,' said the Duck, and she swam away to the end of the pond, and stood
        upon her head, in order to give her children a good example. 'What a silly question!' cried the Water-rat. 'I should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.' 'And what would you do in return?' said the little bird, swinging upon
        a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.It is not in very good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong with the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you. I know it is very generous of me, and a great
        many people would think me extremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the world. I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and, besides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself. Yes, you may set your mind
        at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow."Well, really, that is generous of you," said little Hans, and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure. "I can easily put it in repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house."</blockquote>
